Project created for my university course for creating Android apps. 

This is simple GUI android app which allows the users to enter his first name, last name and the 
amount of subjects for which he wants to enter degrees for calculating his average grade.

The requirements:
- The first name and last name cannot be empty (Can be anything)
- Grades amount has to be between 5 and 15
- The button has to showup only when proper data is entered
- On wrong data insertion, toast should popup saying what field is incorrect
- All subjects should have grade
- On successfull filling the form the user should see his average grade and on closing app see toast about his status.
